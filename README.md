# [demo] Flexbox Flex-flow

Flex-flow is the shorthand for flex-direction and flex-wrap properities. Together these properities define the flex-container main and cross axes. Flexflow accepts either 1 or 2 values (flex-direction and flex-wrap, any order). 

- Default state for flex-direction is: row
- Default state for flex-wrap: nowrap;

- for example: flex-flow: row nowrap;
